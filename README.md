Predictive Analytics for Patient Discharge Using Electronic Health Records

## The original dataset is EHR_data.csv (link: https://doi.org/10.17632/7kv3rctx7m.1)
Discription of dataset: The dataset is Electronic Health Record Predicting collected from a private Hospital in Indonesia. It contains the patients laboratory test results used to determine next patient treatment whether in care or out care patient. The task embedded to the dataset is classification prediction. 

## The Preprocessing Pipeline:
First execute all cells the preprocessing pipeline notebook which will perform preprocessing tasks and save the cleaned data as 'cleaned_data.csv'.

## The Modelling Pipeline:
First execute all cells the modelling pipeline notebook which will load the cleaned data from preprocessing pipeline and perform 5 machine learning models on the it then compare the evaluation metrics for all models and save the best model : random forest as .pkl file.
